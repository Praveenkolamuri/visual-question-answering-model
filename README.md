# Visual Question Answering (VQA) Model

This repository contains the code for a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, which uses pre-trained models from Hugging Face. The model is designed to take an image and a question about the image as inputs and provide an answer to the question.

## Introduction

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a task that involves providing accurate answers to questions about a given image. This project leverages pre-trained models from Hugging Face to achieve high performance on VQA tasks.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained models from Hugging Face
- Easy to use and integrate into other projects
- Supports running in Google Colab for quick experimentation

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praveenkolamuri/vqa-model.git
cd vqa-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the VQA model directly in a Google Colab notebook. Follow these steps:

1. Open the [VQA Colab Notebook](link-to-your-colab-notebook).
2. Upload your images and input questions.
3. Run the cells to get the answers.

Here's an example code snippet for running the model:

```python
from transformers import VqaPipeline
from PIL import Image

# Load the pre-trained model
vqa_pipeline = VqaPipeline.from_pretrained("huggingface/vqa-model")

# Load an image
image = Image.open("path_to_your_image.jpg")

# Ask a question
question = "What is the color of the cat?"

# Get the answer
answer = vqa_pipeline({"image": image, "question": question})

print(answer)
```

## Examples

Here are some example images and questions with their corresponding answers.

| Image | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
|<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0a/cd/84/0acd8446731c49f15a895d9a859e37ad.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="200"/>| How many dogs are in the picture ? | One |

## Model Details

This model uses the `huggingface/vqa-model` pre-trained model, which is based on the transformer architecture. For more details about the model and its performance, please refer to the [Hugging Face model page](link-to-model-page).
